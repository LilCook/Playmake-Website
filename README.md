# Playmake_Website
 I am porting over  a project that me and my team designed at AcademiesHacks 2022.  You can read more about it below.

 Hello everybody, and welcome to our project Playmake! We initially designed this project in May 2022 at AcademiesHacks but we used a different code editor, so I was unable to port it to GitHub, which I am doing today.

 Our project is a website that has custom tracks that you can listen to (created by some members of the team) or you can attempt our new game mode, Musicle (this was made in order to fit in with the hackathon's theme of wordle), which is kind of like a wordle/musical chairs hybrid.
